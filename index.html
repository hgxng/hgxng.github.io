          <h5>Our Founding Philosophy</h5>
          <p> Beyond an overarching urge to strengthen Nigeria and its future which is what the parent HGX organization represents, at the heart of everything we do at HGX Tutoring is a strong belief that all academic knowledge is only truly valuable when the application is clear. The academic system is responsible for producing the vast majority of people who go on to work in industry and as such it follows that a better prepared and sensitised set of students will lead to better performing industries and a better performing nation. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <h5>Our Vision</h5>
          <p> HGX Tutoring foresees a future where useful knowledge about how academic information is useful in the real world is always readily available from human sources. This is because we believe it is important that the purpose of information acquired in school remains a major part of the learning process.</p>

          <h5>Mission of HGX</h5>
          <p> HGX Tutoring seeks to achieve its goals by facilitating the creation of an environment whereby young professionals are able to give back to the younger generation through a part-academic mentorship program.</p>
