          <h5>Welcome To HGX Tutoring! </h5>
          <p> The objective of HGX is to provide private tutoring services that are a cut above the typical and deliver more than just exam scores - tutors are chosen for their ability to do more than teach subjects, but present meaningful applications for the material being taught. </p>
          <p> HGX Tutors have recent experience dealing with the sort of issues that young adults in our target age group (typically 14 to 18 years old) are currently dealing with, academically and otherwise. It represents a form of community service where the best of the older generation of future leaders are positioned in such a way that enables them to share their skills and expertise with the younger ones.</p>

          <h5>Our Founding Philosophy</h5>
          <p> Beyond an overarching urge to strengthen Nigeria and its future which is what the parent HGX organization represents, at the heart of everything we do at HGX Tutoring is a strong belief that all academic knowledge is only truly valuable when the application is clear and understood. The academic system is responsible for producing the vast majority of people who go on to work in industry and as such it follows that a better prepared and sensitised set of students will lead to better performing industries and a better performing nation. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <h5>Our Vision</h5>
          <p> HGX Tutoring foresees a future where all students are made aware of the real-world usefulness and aplications of all academic knowledge. We believe this to be a critical aspect of learning and that it will empower the students to become better leaders in the future.</p>
