          <h5>Welcome To HGX Tutoring! </h5>
          <p> HGX Tutoring provides mentor-style tutoring for young adults (typically aged 14-18 years) that enable them to look beyond their immediate academic goals and become more aware of more substantial issues that affect their lives.</p>
          <p> The HGX Tutor is a young professional adult, a few years older and more experienced than the student. Tutors have recent experience dealing with the sort of issues that our target demographic are currently working through and are therefore better placed to connect with the younger person. They are chosen for being thought leaders and for the dynamic nature of their own career development and very importantly, their commitment to sustainable development of the country.</p>
          <p> By design, the HGX Tutoring process is entirely bespoke – each tutor-student relationship is defined on a case-by-case basis through nuanced discussions involving the parents, student and HGX. We believe this is necessary to truly create a productive and mutually beneficial relationship. It is important to note that HGX does not shun the academic aspect of the young person’s life and HGX Tutors also bring their own demonstrated academic ability to the table to make for a robust and well-rounded experience.</p>
