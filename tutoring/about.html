        <h5>Our Founding Philosophy</h5>
        <p> Beyond an overarching urge to strengthen Nigeria and its future which is what the parent HGX organization represents, at the heart of everything we do at HGX Tutoring is a strong belief that all academic knowledge is only truly valuable when the application is clear and understood. The academic system is responsible for producing the vast majority of people who go on to work in industry and as such, it follows that a better prepared and sensitised set of students will lead to better performing industries and a better performing nation. </p>

      <div class="content">
        <h5>Our Vision</h5>
        <p> HGX foresees a future where all students are made aware of the real-world usefulness and aplications of all academic knowledge. We believe this to be a critical aspect of learning and that it will empower the students to become better leaders in the future.</p>

        <h5>Mission of HGX</h5>
        <p> The goal is a more intellectually lucid younger generation and HGX seeks to achieve it though meaningful interactions. These interactions are facilitated by creating environments where the best of the young professional demographic is able to “pay forward” their strengths with their mentorship.</p>
